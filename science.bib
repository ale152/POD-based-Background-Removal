abstract = "Abstract State-of-art preprocessing methods for Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) are severely challenged by time-dependent light reflections and strongly non-uniform background. In this work, a novel image preprocessing method is proposed. The method is based on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) of the image recording sequence and exploits the different spatial and temporal coherence of background and particles. After describing the theoretical framework, the method is tested on synthetic and experimental images, and compared with well-known pre-processing techniques in terms of image quality enhancement, improvements in the \{PIV\} interrogation and computational cost. The results show that, unlike existing techniques, the proposed method is robust in the presence of significant background noise intensity, gradients, and temporal oscillations. Moreover, the computational cost is one to two orders of magnitude lower than conventional image normalization methods. A downloadable version of the preprocessing toolbox has been made available at http://seis.bris.ac.uk/aexrt/PIVPODPreprocessing/. "
